# Building-a-Music-Streaming-Platform-Spotify-Clone-with-HTML-and-CSS
1.This project is a Spotify clone built using HTML and CSS, featuring a modern interface for browsing music. Users can view album art, song titles, and artist names, with intuitive controls for play and pause. It showcases my front-end development skills by creating a responsive and visually appealing music player.

2.In the next phase, I plan to integrate JavaScript to enhance interactivity and functionality. This will include features like dynamic song playback, playlist management, and user interactions such as searching and filtering songs. By adding these capabilities, I aim to create a fully functional music streaming experience that mimics the features of Spotify.
