# Building-a-Music-Streaming-Platform-Spotify-Clone-with-HTML-and-CSS
This project is a Spotify clone built using HTML and CSS, featuring a modern interface for browsing music. Users can view album art, song titles, and artist names, with intuitive controls for play and pause. It showcases my front-end development skills by creating a responsive and visually appealing music player.
